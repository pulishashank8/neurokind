Here, the Marketplace should remain available, as this is where users can find the Amazon links. Please do not remove it. I want the Marketplace to stay, and it should also be added under Platform in the navigation bar.
I am still not satisfied with the color of the “Get Help” button. When the background is white, the button is not visible at all. This needs to be fixed.
The Sign Out button should not be placed directly in the navigation bar. Please remove it from there and move it under Platform, below Settings.
Please change the quotation. The “Black Potato” quotation should be a strong, impactful quotation, but it is currently too large. Reduce the font size, as it is visually overwhelming.
Regarding the black-and-white theme switch:
When switching to dark mode, the moon icon is clear and understandable.
However, when switching back (to light mode), the icon is confusing and not intuitive.
Please improve this so users can clearly understand the purpose of the button in both states.
The quotation itself is fine in length, but it needs additional content to make it more meaningful. Keep it concise, but not overly minimal. Also, reduce its overall size on the screen.
I do not think we need multiple Help buttons. We already have a “Get Help” button at the top, and there is another Help button in the Support Tools section. This is redundant. Please remove the extra Help button.
The Emergency Card does not need to appear on the front screen. There are currently too many elements displayed, and some of them are unnecessary. Please clean up the front screen and remove anything that is not essential.
The website must be fully responsive and work properly across all devices, including:
iPad
iPhone
Android phones (Samsung, Google, etc.)
Tablets
Laptops
Large monitors
Projectors
It should adapt smoothly to all screen sizes without layout or usability issues.
Please review the platform and let me know if:
Anything else should be changed
Any labels or feature names should be renamed to make them easier to understand
Before deployment, check all errors thoroughly. I do not want:
Dependency errors
Build issues
Runtime failures
Security is critical. I do not want:
Any data leakage
Any security vulnerabilities
Any code leakage
The application should be well-protected against hacking attempts and built following strong security best practices. It must be stable, secure, and production-ready.
Regarding the quotations: I understand now, and I like the idea. The quotation should change automatically. Please include 10 to 15 different quotations that rotate over time.
Overall, this is a good idea, and I really like the direction.
