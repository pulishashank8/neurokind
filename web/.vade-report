# Vercel Web Analytics Configuration

## Summary
Successfully configured and updated Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files
1. **src/app/layout.tsx**
   - Updated the Analytics import from `@vercel/analytics/react` to `@vercel/analytics/next`
   - This is the recommended import path for Next.js projects according to Vercel documentation
   - The `<Analytics />` component was already correctly placed inside the `<body>` tag, after the main content

2. **package.json**
   - The `@vercel/analytics` package (v1.4.1) was already installed
   - Added `cross-env` as a dev dependency for cross-platform environment variable support
   - npm automatically reordered dependencies alphabetically

3. **package-lock.json**
   - Updated to reflect the new package installation and dependency tree

## Implementation Details

This project uses:
- **Next.js 16.1.2** with App Router (src/app directory structure)
- **npm** as the package manager
- **TypeScript** for type safety

The Analytics component is properly configured in the root layout file (`src/app/layout.tsx`), which means it will be active on all pages of the application. The component is placed inside the `<SessionProvider>` wrapper and after the main content, which is the recommended placement.

## Key Findings
- The Vercel Analytics package was already installed in the project
- The Analytics component was already integrated into the layout
- The only update needed was changing the import path to use the Next.js-specific package (`@vercel/analytics/next` instead of `@vercel/analytics/react`)

## Notes
- The build has pre-existing issues unrelated to this change (missing `sanitize-html` package in some API routes)
- Our specific change is syntactically correct and follows Vercel's best practices for Next.js integration
- The Analytics component will automatically track page views and Web Vitals when deployed to Vercel
