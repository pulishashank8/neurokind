## Known Issues & Deployment Notes

### Next.js 16 Build Bug (January 2025)
Next.js 16.1.4 has a known prerendering bug that causes build failures with errors like:
- "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')"
- "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')"

**Affected pages**: Any page using React hooks in client components during static export

**Workaround options**:
1. Wait for official Next.js patch (recommended)
2. Downgrade to Next.js 14.x if compatibility allows
3. Deploy directly to Vercel which may handle build differently in their environment

**Current status**: Local development works perfectly. Production builds fail during static generation phase.

### Email Verification
Email verification is bypassed in development mode (NODE_ENV !== 'production') for easier testing.
